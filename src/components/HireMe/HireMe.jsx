          That's right, I'm not above taking advantage of the fact that my dog
          is <em>outrageously handsome</em> to try and snag a job.

        <p>I'd be happy to tell you more about him (and me). You can:</p>
        <button>Book a meeting</button>
        <button>Connect on LinkedIn</button>
        <button>Email me</button>
        <p>
          Alternatively, walk into any Montr√©al pub showing Premier League
          football and look for the big guy who sounds like Jon Snow: 50/50 shot
          that's me.
