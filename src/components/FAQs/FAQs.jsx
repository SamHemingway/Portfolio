            Well it's certainly not a degree in Computer Science (I studied
            landscape architecture at school, in case you're curious!).
          </p>
          <p>
            What differentiates me comes down to soft-skills. I've worked at
            companies ranging from 
            <a href="https://www.nationwide.co.uk">national banks</a>, to 
            <a href="https://www.poka.io">start-ups</a>, to being the 4th sales
            hire at one of the 
            <a href="https://www.hopin.com">
              fastest growing companies in history
            </a> 
            who had a front row seat as it scaled from 100 to more than 1000
            employees in under a year.

            When you hire me, you know that 
            <a href="#why">

      title: "12 months without work?",
      content: `<p>A very valid question. The short version:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I spent ~3 months interviewing for sales positions before
              realising that the reason that I kept on withdrawing from the
              interview process wasn't because, as I kept telling myself, it
              <em>"wasn't the right opportunity"</em>. It was because I simply
              didn't want to do it anymore, combined with the fact that that my
              side-project of developing my programming skills was more
              intellectually stimulating than any deal I'd ever closed.
            </li>
            <li>
              So I decided to focus on that full-time. <strong>Boom</strong>:
              COVID. For around 3 months, I endured brain fog, aching joints and
              a complete inability to stay awake throughout the day.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once I recovered, I spent 6 weeks on vacation visiting family
              (plus enjoying being able to taste food again) before returning
              and throwing myself into my studies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Now, I'm chomping at the bit to start the next chapter in my
              career üí™

    {
      title: "How did you learn to code?",
      content: `<p>
            Self-taught. I looked at boot camps, but outside of the networking
            opportunities, I wasn't convinced they were value for money.
          </p>
          <p>If you're interested in which specific courses I completed:</p>
          <ul>

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Otherwise, I independently honed my skills via resources like:</p>

              <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/SamHemingway">Codewars</a> 
              to test my understanding of basic JS concepts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using official documentation to learn React libraries like
