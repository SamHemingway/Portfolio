        <Disclosure.Button>Where are you based?</Disclosure.Button>
        <Disclosure.Panel>
          Montr√©al, Canada, where I have permanent residency (I'm originally
          from the UK)!

        <Disclosure.Button>Do you speak French?</Disclosure.Button>
        <Disclosure.Panel>
          Oui, au niveau B2. Mais je n'ai jamais eu l'occasion de l'utiliser
          dans la vie professionnelle - tous les emplois que j'ai occup√©s
          jusqu'√† pr√©sent l'ont √©t√© a les entreprises o√π l'anglais est la langue
          principale.

          What makes you different from other junior engineers?
        </Disclosure.Button>
        <Disclosure.Panel>
          <p>
            Well it's certainly not a degree in Computer Science (I studied
            landscape architecture at school, in case you're curious!).
          </p>
          <p>
            What differentiates me comes down to soft-skills. I've worked at
            companies ranging from{" "}
            <a href="https://www.nationwide.co.uk">national banks</a>, to{" "}
            <a href="https://www.poka.io">start-ups</a>, to being the 4th sales
            hire at one of the{" "}
            <a href="https://www.hopin.com">
              fastest growing companies in history
            </a>{" "}
            who had a front row seat as it scaled from 100 to more than 1000
            employees in under a year.

            When you hire me, you know that{" "}

          You've been out of work for over a year... what happened?!
        </Disclosure.Button>
        <Disclosure.Panel>
          <p>A very valid question. The short version:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I spent ~3 months interviewing for sales positions before
              realising that the reason that I kept on withdrawing from the
              interview process wasn't because, as I kept telling myself, it{" "}
              <em>"wasn't the right opportunity"</em>. It was because I simply
              didn't want to do it anymore, combined with the fact that that my
              side-project of developing my programming skills on the side was
              more intellectually stimulating than any deal I'd ever closed.
            </li>
            <li>
              So I decided to focus on that full-time. <strong>Boom</strong>:
              COVID. For 3 months, I endured brain fog, aching joints and the
              complete inability to stay awake throughout the day.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once I recovered, I spent 6 weeks visiting family/enjoying being
              able to taste food again on vacation before returning and throwing
              myself into my studies refreshed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Now, I'm chomping at the bit to start the next chapter in my
              career üí™

        <Disclosure.Button>How did you learn how to code?</Disclosure.Button>
        <Disclosure.Panel>
          <p>
            Self-taught. I looked at boot camps, but outside of the networking
            opportunities, I wasn't convinced they were value for money.
          </p>
          <p>If you're interested in which specific courses I completed:</p>

          </ul>
          <p>Otherwise, I independently honed my skills via resources like:</p>
