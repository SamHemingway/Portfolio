            As my first app working from a database, there are too many learning
            moments to count. Here are just a few:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Components: how to structure them components so they would be easy
              to use when being consumed. I leaned heavily into using the
              children prop, and also feel like I've started developing my
              understanding of when to give more control to the consumer (e.g.
              using a delegated prop), and which aspects of a component need to
              be set in stone.
            </li>
            <li>
              State management: I realized part way through this project that
              there were multiple pieces of state that were required in multiple
              components, and passing them down as props was becoming unwieldy.
              This lead to me learning and implementing React context throughout
              my entire app to manage state.
            </li>
            <li>
              UI updating from state: I had a lot of fun implementing specific
              colour schemes for each race; it felt like a fun touch to bring
              the mood of each race into the UI in this way.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </>

          <p>
            In my career, I’ve been guilty of overthinking my work and trying to
            lay perfect foundations before jumping in. This leads to analysis
            paralysis, and the work suffers as a result.
          </p>

          <p>
            I felt that urge in this project, so I decided to run a little
            experiment: I consciously decided to start building the app without
            preparing any extensive foundations first (e.g. a design system,
            what kind of data structure to use etc).
          </p>

          <p>
            This lead to growing pains as the project progressed, such as having
            to re-write my data structure multiple times to support
            functionality.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don’t regret this choice: quickly iterating and prototyping
            different data structures helped me build a better understanding of
            what will be required for future projects.
          </p>

          <p>
            What I did come to regret, however, was not putting other basics in
            place: for example, I didn’t implement a consistent design token
            system until most of the components were already built. This lead to
            hours of labourious work as I went back over my app and removed all
            the magic numbers that were sprinkled in everywhere.

          <p>
            For the majority of the interactable components (modals, tooltips,
            select inputs etc), I set a challenge to get as far as possible
            building them myself. When I reached my limits (mostly around
            accessibility), I then turned to headless libraries like Radix UI.
          </p>

          <p>
            I built them with the view that I would be re-using them later in
            future portfolio projects, so the investment now would save time
            later.
          </p>

          <p>
            I had moments where I invested a lot of time building something
            myself, only to realize I couldn’t implement something in a complete
            way (for example, a tooltip that is aware of collisions). I also had
            moments where learning the API of a component library felt like it
            was taking more time than just trying to build something myself.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have no regrets at trying to build things myself: failing at
            something is the best way to learn. But I also understand why so
            many developers, with actual time/resource constraints in real
            projects, would turn to these libraries. They’re great.

            The game has 24 races, each of which has 1-8 characters to play. I
            chose the simple option of mimicking this relationship with an array
            of objects for each race, each containing an array of lords.
          </p>

          <p>
            I opted early on to store progress in the browsers local storage, as
            I felt potential users would be put off by any requirement for an
            account.
          </p>

          <p>
            As for what data to store, a choice: do I store the entire database,
            or just what the user submits.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whilst I felt that, in this case, storing everything might not be
            prohibitive from a performance perspective, it might be in future
            projects. As such, I wanted to get practice storing only what was
            absolutely necessary and interpolating that data into the UI.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was more of a challenge to build this way, but I’m glad to have
            got the practice.

            To force myself to test this app using a screen-reader, I turned my
            computer monitor off and used my keyboard only. This helped me
            discover issues ranging from minor (such as buttons announcing
            themselves twice), to major ones like focus not being pulled into
            modals.
          </p>

          <p>
            I would have never have found these issues without trying to use the
            app in this way. Unfortunately, there are still some issues I’ve
            been unable to resolve (such as the toast notifications announcing
            themselves after a modal is closed).

            When I used CSS Modules in this portfolio website, I came across a
            few annoyances (such as having to use really hacky feeling code to
            have style be informed by state, for example).
          </p>

          <p>
            Accordingly, I decided to use this project to learn Styled
            Components.
          </p>

          <p>
            I enjoyed it: it felt like a more intuitive way of working in
            components: and designing components by their state felt a lot
            easier.

            I knew early on that this was going to be an image-heavy site. When
            I initially built the site using pngs, the UX was poor: not only was
            layout shift distracting as images loaded in , but — even worse —
            the user couldn’t traverse the UI on slow connections due to waiting
            for images to load.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thankfully, my audience — gamers — generally use modern computers
            modern browsers. This allowed me to utilise the avif format for my
            images.
          </p>

          <p>
            The result was an approximately 85-90% reduction in all image sizes,
            almost entirely eliminating layout shift and making the UX much more
            smooth overall for a very small loss in image quality.
