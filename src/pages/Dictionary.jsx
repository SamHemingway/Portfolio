            to build experience working with web APIs. I chose to interpret the
            search functionality as updating the result live, rather than the
            user manually submitting a search.
          </p>
          <p>
            The issue: how did I ensure that I wasn't blasting the API with a
            request for every character the user typed?
          </p>
          <p>
            A bit of Googling lead to me learning about debouncing. I built a
            simple hook to debounce the text input to make a GET request after
            enough time had passed that the user would most likely have stopped
            typing (500ms).

          <p>
            After building an MVP of the search functionality, I asked my
            partner and my parents (the ultimate test) to use the app to get
            real life feedback on how intuitive it was to use. Here's what I
            learned:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              They didn't know that all they had to do was type: their instinct
              was to put a word into the search input and hit enter.
            </li>
            <li>
              After they'd done that, they weren't sure if the app was working
              or not: there was no feedback that the word had been accepted as
              the app was not only waiting for the bounced value, but then also
              had to fetch the data.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>This feedback lead to me implementing two UX changes:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              I'd never implemented a loading skeleton before, and it felt like
              this would tackle both of the above identified issues. Now, the
              moment a user starts typing, the loading skeleton appears to
              inform the user that the app is loading a result.
            </li>
            <li>
              It made a lot of sense that people will hit 'enter' in these
              situations. I felt the best way to handle this "unnecessary"
              action was to simply mimic the behaviour of what the user would
              expect if they pressed enter on an input: disable focus on the
              input.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </>
      ),
    },

            Wherever possible, I try to avoid using media queries to implement
            changes to layout â€” for example, it feels a little clunky when a
            heading suddenly shifts from 36px to 64px.
          </p>
          <p>
            This lead me to learn more about the CSS clamp function, and how we
            can use{" "}
            <a href="https://fluidtypography.com/#app-get-started">
              fluid typography
            </a>{" "}
            tools to implement them.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it's simply not scalable to go to a website, plug in your
            values and then paste the result into your app.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, I did what any <del>lazy</del> efficient developer would do... I
            wrote{" "}
            <a href="https://github.com/SamHemingway/dictionary-web-app/blob/main/src/helpers/calculateLinearInterpolation.jsx">
              a reusable function to do it for me
            </a>{" "}
            with full documntation using JSDoc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, I simply use this function when building my CSS custom
            properties for any layout element that needs to smoothly transition
            between 2 sizes when the viewport width changes.
