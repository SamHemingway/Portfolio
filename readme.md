# Challenges I faced along the way

## Accessibility

Testing for accessibility was a very interesting and fun challenge to solve. I have to admit that, before this exercise, I never truly understood the importance of using semantic HTML. I certainly do now.

Before I even really touched styling/behaviour, I spent a lot of time using VoiceOver to test my HTML and make sure that navigating the site this way actually made sense.

For example, making sure that the mobile hamburger menu was accessible via screen-reader.

Specifically: Adding social icons to the navigation area was surprisingly tricky.
